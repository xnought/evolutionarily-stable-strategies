# ESS: Evolutionarily Stable Stragies

Simulations trying to find the ESS in various simple models.

The main idea is that we have rock-paper-scissor dynamics in a population. Then, that population randomly gets matched and scores are summed for various starting population proportions.

Strategies that result in stable population numbers will be favored since anything else will be punished.

Most of this is from talks in [The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) and I just wanted to experiment for myself.
